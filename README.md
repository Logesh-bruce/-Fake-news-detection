## Project Description

162-4Fake news spreads rapidly online, potentially causing social, political, and economic harm. This project leverages machine learning (and optionally deep learning or graph‑based techniques) to automatically flag misleading news articles for further review. 

---

## Dataset

162-5We use a labeled dataset with the following structure: 

- 162-6*train.csv / test.csv*: 
  - 162-7id: unique identifier   
  - 162-8title: article title   
  - 162-9author: (optional) author name   
  - 162-10text: full article body   
  - 162-11label: 0 = real, 1 = fake

## Approach & Models

- *Algorithms tested*:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - 1341-1Passive‑Aggressive Classifier  17  
  - 1635-0(Optional advanced) BERT/RoBERTa for richer language understanding  19  
- 1729-0*Evaluation Metrics*: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

Usage

1. Train Model

python src/train_model.py \
  --data data/train.csv \
  --output_model models/model.pkl \
  --output_vectorizer models/vectorizer.pkl

2. Run Evaluation

python src/train_model.py \
  --test_data data/test.csv \
  --model models/model.pkl \
  --vectorizer models/vectorizer.pkl

Metrics (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix) will display in console or notebook.

3. Launch Web App

cd app
streamlit run app.py           # or flask run

Navigate to http://localhost:8501 (or 5000) to enter news articles and see live predictions.


---

Evaluation

Expect performance similar to:

Model	Accuracy

Passive‑Aggressive	~96 %    
Logistic Regression	~92–94 %
Random Forest / XGB	~95 %
BERT / RoBERTa (deep NLP)	98 %+    


Use scikit-learn classification reports and visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to plot confusion matrices and ROC curves.


---

Results

Passive‑Aggressive Classifier achieved ~96% accuracy  

BERT/RoBERTa models reached up to ~98% on the LIAR dataset  
(Include confusion matrix images and charts from your analysis.)



---

Deployment

Streamlit or Flask app serves as a lightweight UI

Save and load trained model.pkl & vectorizer.pkl

(Optional: Dockerize for production deployment)



---

Contributing

1. Fork the repo


2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature)


3. Commit with clear messages


4. Submit a pull request

### 💡 Tips for Customizing Your README

- *Visuals*: Embed sample confusion matrix and architecture diagrams.
- *Usage Examples*: Add quick CLI or API usage snippets.
- *Live Demo*: Link to a deployed Streamlit or Flask demo.
- *Citation*: Reference base datasets (e.g., Kaggle, LIAR) and any academic models used.
